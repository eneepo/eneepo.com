Events in Kubernetes provide insight into the state of resources within the cluster. They capture significant occurrences such as pod creation, deletion, errors, warnings, and other relevant events. These events are invaluable for monitoring, debugging, and auditing purposes. Each event contains information such as the type of event, the object involved, the reason for the event, and a timestamp.

Events are automatically generated by the Kubernetes system and controllers in response to various actions and conditions. They are stored in the cluster's etcd database and can be queried using the Kubernetes API. Events have limited retention and may be purged after a certain period, depending on the cluster configuration.
